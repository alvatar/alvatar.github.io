	    Hello. I am Álvaro Castro-Castilla <a href="https://github.com/alvatar">(@alvatar)</a>. I am a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/castrocastilla/">software engineer</a> and an artist.
	    As an engineer, I specialize in distributed systems. But that is not the purpose of this web page.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    As an artist, I work at the intersection of traditional techniques like acrylic and oil with cutting-edge software technology.
	    The result of this are <strong>Paintings and Digital Entities made of Self-Modifying Code, Neural Networks, Cellular Automata and Evolutionary Computations</strong>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    From 2001 to 2010, digital art & architecture were my primary interests, and so I created my first digital art projects while still a student of Architecture at
	    Escuela Politécnica de Arquitectura de Madrid. This was an era that didn't know about social networks, the iPhone, or many of the creative tools available nowadays.
	    For instance, in my first years I wasn't even allowed to use the computer for drawing plans in university.</br>
	    At that time, I started coding in C/C++ and OpenGL, and I became aware of the importance of being <em>close to the metal</em> to create purely digital beings with
	    a real understanding of their internals. That is required to feel and understand what makes software entities exist in their own electrical universe. Digital constructs,
	    just like architecture is in space, or music is in sound and time. Some of the things I worked on back then have now become commonplace, like neural networks or touch devices.
	    However, during nearly a decade (2010-2019), I stayed away of creating art, and focused almost exclusively on software engineering and entrepreneurial projects.
	    In 2019, I felt again the need to continue the journey to shape a language in art combining the engineering and technical knowledge I've acquired over
	    the years, together with my passion for fine arts.
	    These are the exhibitions I've participated in the past:
