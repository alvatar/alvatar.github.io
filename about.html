	  <p>
	    Hello. I am Álvaro Castro-Castilla <a href="https://github.com/alvatar">(@alvatar)</a>. I am a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/castrocastilla/">software engineer</a> and artist.
	    As an engineer, I specialize in distributed systems and blockchain infrastructure. But that is not the purpose of this web page.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    As an artist, I work at the intersection of traditional abstract painting and the digital reality.
	    My main approach is through a man-machine dialog: using advanced software tools like Machine Learning, I develop code that learns and projects my work in the physical world
	    onto the digital one, and vice versa.
	    The result of this are <strong>combinations of Paintings and Digital Entities made of Neural Networks, Cellular Automata, Self-Modifying Code and Evolutionary Computations</strong>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    From 2001 to 2010, digital art & architecture were my primary interests, and so I created my first digital art projects while still a student of Architecture at
	    Escuela Politécnica de Arquitectura de Madrid.
	    This was an era that didn't know about social networks, the iPhone, or many of the creative tools of nowadays.</br>
	    It was then when I started coding in C/C++/OpenGL.
	    Since my beginnings, I became sensitive to the importance of being <em>close to the metal</em> to work on the creation of purely digital entities.
	    As a consequence, I've pursued always a deep understanding of the mechanisms of software, the algorithms and structures that construct these machines existing in a different plane of reality.

	    During nearly a decade (2010-2019), I stayed away from art, and focused almost exclusively on software engineering and entrepreneurial projects.
	    In 2019, my old passion for art and my profession as software engineer and entrepreneur converged. I felt again the need to continue the journey to shape a
	    language in art combining the engineering and technical knowledge I've acquired over the years, together with my passion for fine arts.
	    These are the exhibitions I've participated on:
