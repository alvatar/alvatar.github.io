	  <p>
	    Hello. I am Álvaro Castro-Castilla <a href="https://github.com/alvatar">(@alvatar)</a>. An architect, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/castrocastilla/">software engineer</a> and artist.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    I work at the intersection of traditional techniques like acrylic and oil with cutting-edge software technology.
	    The result of this are <strong>Digital Entities made of Self-Modifying Code, Neural Networks, Cellular Automata and Evolutionary Computations</strong>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    From 2001 to 2010, digital art & architecture were my primary interests, and so I created my first digital art projects while still studying at
	    Escuela Politécnica de Arquitectura de Madrid. This was a time that didn't know about social networks, the iPhone, or many of the creative tools available nowadays.
	    I coded in C/C++, CUDA and OpenGL, because I always believed that you needed to be <em>close to the metal</em> to create purely digital beings with
	    a real understanding of their internals. That was required to feel and understand what makes software entities exist in their own electrical universe.
	    Some of the things I worked on have now become commonplace, like neural networks or touch devices. However, during nearly a decade
	    (2010-2019), I stayed away of creating art, while focused almost exclusively on software engineering and entrepreneurial projects.
	    But in 2019, I felt again the need to continue the journey to shape a language in art combining the engineering and technical knowledge I've acquired over
	    the years, together with my passion for fine arts.
	    These are the exhibitions I've participated in the past:
